# CODE REVIEW: Simple Timer

## INTRODUCTION

***First Code Review Course Requirement***

	This repository was created in order to fulfill the first code review requirement contained with the first module of [Lighthouse Labs' - Web Development Program][Lighthouse Labs - Web Development Program].  



***General Exercise Overview*** 

	Exercise combines student's prior experience with command line arguments and asynchronous programming in JavaScript in order to implement a simple timer/alarm function.  

***Specific Functional Requirements***

	Timer/alarm function intakes a series of times from the user that determine the number & timing (delay) that function returns a beep via computer speaker.  
 		* User can input series of numbers (times) via command line when running app 
 		* Function returns series of beeps: 
			* number of beeps equal to number of inputted times
			* delay of each beep equals the number value of the user's inputted times
 		* There is no limit to number of inputted times (0 to infinite) 
		* Function ignores non-numbers & any negative numbers inputted by user
